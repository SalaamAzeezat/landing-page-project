# Description
This project is built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It implements DOM manipulation to create a nav menu dynamically, highlight section when scrolled and to toggle active class.

# Instructions
The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. The project needs to be converted to an interactive one by modifying the starter code, but primarily the JavaScript file.


# Index
This file represents the skeleton of the landing page.
In the header tag, you'll find the <nav> element which would need to be populated with an unordered list using javascript.
In the <main> tag, an extra section was added to make four sections containing lorem ipsum text that can be easily changed in the future. 


# Styles
This gives the landing page the look and feel that you see and experience. Starter code provided by Udacity.
 

# App
Here is where the functionality happens. The navigation menu was dynamically built by populating the nav menu with an unordered list. An active state was implemented on both the nav menu and the section to highlight the section currently "active" in the page. It also listens for click events on the navigation menu and then scrolls the page to the appropriate section.
